# Project 0

This is a basic homepage app about me; it has four functioning, albeit brief, pages. A couple of neat things for me include the navbar, which I used from bootstrap, and the table, also from bootstrap. I struggled a bit with the column layout as you can see on the interests page, as they don't span fully. I thought it was neat to use <span> to make the list colors different from the bullet covers.

It's amazing to me how much bootstrap has automated most of this.
